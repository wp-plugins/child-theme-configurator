"<h5>Does it work with Plugins?</h5>\n"
"<p>We offer a premium extension to let you easily modify styles for any "
"WordPress Plugin installed on your website. The Child Theme Configurator "
"Plugin Extension scans your plugins and allows you to create custom "
"stylesheets in your Child Theme. <a href=\"http://www.lilaeamedia.com/"

"Extension\">Learn more</a></p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"doesnt_work\">Why doesn’t this work with my (insert theme vendor "
"here) theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>Some themes (particularly commercial themes) do not adhere to the Theme "
"Development guidelines set forth by WordPress.org, and do not correctly load "
"parent template files or automatically load child theme stylesheets or php "
"files.</p>\n"
"<p>This is unfortunate, because in the best case they effectively prohibit "
"the webmaster from adding any customizations (other than those made through "
"the admin theme options) that will survive past an upgrade. <strong>In the "
"worst case they will break your website when you activate the child theme.</"
"strong></p>\n"
"<p>Contact the vendor directly to ask for this core functionality. It is our "
"opinion that ALL themes (especially commercial ones) must pass the Theme "
"Unit Tests outlined by WordPress.org.</p>\n"
"<h5>Can I edit the Child Theme stylesheet manually offline or by using the "
"Editor or do I have to use the Configurator?</h5>\n"
"<p>You can make any manual changes you wish to the stylesheet. Just make "
"sure you import the revised stylesheet using the Parent/Child panel or the "
"Configurator will overwrite your changes the next time you use it. Just "
"follow the steps as usual but select the \"Use Existing Child Theme\" radio "
"button as the \"Child Theme\" option. The Configurator will automatically "
"update its internal data from the new stylesheet.</p>\n"
"<h5>Why doesn't the Parent Theme have any styles when I \"View Parent CSS\"?"
"</h5>\n"
"<p>Your Parent theme is probably using a separate location for the "
"stylesheets. Select individual stylesheets from the \"Parse Additional "
"Stylesheets\" section of the Parent/Child tab and click \"Generate Child "
"Theme Files\" again.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"menus-broken\">Why are my menus displaying incorrectly when I "
"activate the new child theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>The child theme creates a new instance in the WordPress options data and "
"the menus have to be assigned. Go to Appearance &gt; Menus and assign "
"locations to each of the menus for the new Child Theme.</p>\n"
"<h5 \"preview-not-loading\">Why do the preview tabs return \"Stylesheet "
"could not be displayed\"?</h5>\n"
"<p>You have to configure at least one child theme from the Parent/Child tab "
"for the preview to display.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"specific_color\">How do I change a specific color/font style/"
"background?</h5>\n"
"<p>You can override a specific value globally using the Rule/Value tab. See "
"Rule/Value, above.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"add_styles\">How do I add styles that aren't in the Parent Theme?</"
"h5>\n"
"<p>You can add queries and selectors using the \"New Selector(s)\" textarea "
"on the Query/Selector tab. See Query/Selector, above.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"add_styles\">How do I remove a style from the Parent Theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>You shouldn't really \"remove\" a style from the Parent. You can, "
"however, set the rule to \"inherit,\" \"none,\" or zero (depending on the "
"rule). This will negate the Parent value. Some experimentation may be "
"necessary.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"remove_styles\">How do I remove a style from the Child Theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>Delete the value from the input for the rule you wish to remove. The "
"Child Theme Configurator only adds overrides for rules that contain values.</"
"p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"important_flag\">How do I set the !important flag?</h5>\n"
"<p>We always recommend relying on good cascading design over global "
"overrides. To that end, you have ability to change the load order of child "
"theme styles by entering a value in the \"Order\" field. And yes, you can "
"now set rules as important by checking the \"!\" box next to each input. "
"Please use judiciously.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"gradients\">How do I create cross-browser gradients?</h5>\n"
"<p>The Child Theme Configurator automatically generates the vendor prefixes "
"and filters to display gradients across most browsers. It uses a normalized "
"syntax and only supports two colors without intermediate stops. The inputs "
"consist of origin (e.g., top, left, 135deg, etc.), start color and end "
"color. The browser-specific syntax is generated automatically when you save "
"these values. <strong>Note:</strong> For Internet Explorer, a filter rule "
"approximates the gradient but can only be horizontal (origin top) or "
"vertical (origin left). The legacy webkit-gradient syntax is not supported.</"
"p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"responsive\">How do I make my Theme responsive?</h5>\n"
"<p>The short answer is to use a responsive Parent Theme. Some common "
"characteristics of responsive design are:</p>\n"
"<ul><li>Avoiding fixed width and height values. Using max- and min-height "
"values and percentages are ways to make your designs respond to the viewer's "
"browser size.</li>\n"
"<li>Combining floats and clears with inline and relative positions allow the "
"elements to adjust gracefully to their container's width.</li>\n"
"<li>Showing and hiding content with Javascript.</li></ul>\n"
"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/"
"iBiiAgsK4G4?rel=0&modestbranding=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></"
"iframe> \n"
"<h5 id=\"web_fonts\">How do I add Web Fonts?</h5>\n"
"<p>The easiest method is to paste the @import code provided by Google, Font "
"Squirrel or any other Web Font site into the @import tab. The fonts will "
"then be available to use as a value of the <strong>font-family</strong> "
"rule. Be sure you understand the license for any embedded fonts.</p>\n"
"<p>You can also create a secondary stylesheet that contains @font-face rules "
"and import it using the @import tab. <strong>Note:</strong> Currently the "
"Child Theme Configurator does not generate previews of imported web fonts, "
"but will in a later release.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"functions_file\">Where are the PHP files?</h5>\n"
"<p>The configurator automatically adds a blank functions.php file to the "
"child theme directory. Other parent theme files can be copied using the "
"\"Files\" tab. Theme images and a custom screenshot can be uploaded there as "
"well.</p>\n"
