"<h5 id=\"specific_color\">How do I change a specific color/font style/"
"background?</h5>\n"
"<p>You can override a specific value globally using the Rule/Value tab. See "
"Rule/Value, above.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"add_styles\">How do I add styles that aren't in the Parent Theme?</"
"h5>\n"
"<p>You can add queries and selectors using the \"New Selector(s)\" textarea "
"on the Query/Selector tab. See Query/Selector, above.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"add_styles\">How do I remove a style from the Parent Theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>You shouldn't really \"remove\" a style from the Parent. You can, "
"however, set the rule to \"inherit,\" \"none,\" or zero (depending on the "
"rule). This will negate the Parent value. Some experimentation may be "
"necessary.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"remove_styles\">How do I remove a style from the Child Theme?</h5>\n"
"<p>Delete the value from the input for the rule you wish to remove. The "
"Child Theme Configurator only adds overrides for rules that contain values.</"
"p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"important_flag\">How do I set the !important flag?</h5>\n"
"<p>We always recommend relying on good cascading design over global "
"overrides. To that end, you have ability to change the load order of child "
"theme styles by entering a value in the \"Order\" field. And yes, you can "
"now set rules as important by checking the \"!\" box next to each input. "
"Please use judiciously.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"gradients\">How do I create cross-browser gradients?</h5>\n"
"<p>The Child Theme Configurator automatically generates the vendor prefixes "
"and filters to display gradients across most browsers. It uses a normalized "
"syntax and only supports two colors without intermediate stops. The inputs "
"consist of origin (e.g., top, left, 135deg, etc.), start color and end "
"color. The browser-specific syntax is generated automatically when you save "
"these values. <strong>Note:</strong> For Internet Explorer, a filter rule "
"approximates the gradient but can only be horizontal (origin top) or "
"vertical (origin left). The legacy webkit-gradient syntax is not supported.</"
"p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"responsive\">How do I make my Theme responsive?</h5>\n"
"<p>This topic is beyond the scope of this document. The short answer is to "
"use a responsive Parent Theme. Some common characteristics of responsive "
"design are:\n"
"<ul><li>Avoiding fixed width and height values. Using max- and min-height "
"values and percentages are ways to make your designs respond to the viewer's "
"browser size.</li>\n"
"<li>Combining floats and clears with inline and relative positions allow the "
"elements to adjust gracefully to their container's width.</li>\n"
"<li>Showing and hiding content with Javascript.</li></ul>\n"
"<h5 id=\"web_fonts\">How do I add Web Fonts?</h5>\n"
"<p>The easiest method is to paste the @import code provided by Google, Font "
"Squirrel or any other Web Font site into the @import tab. The fonts will "
"then be available to use as a value of the <strong>font-family</strong> "
"rule. Be sure you understand the license for any embedded fonts.</p>\n"
"<p>You can also create a secondary stylesheet that contains @font-face rules "
"and import it using the @import tab. <strong>Note:</strong> Currently the "
"Child Theme Configurator does not generate previews of imported web fonts, "
"but will in a later release.</p>\n"
"<h5 id=\"functions_file\">Where is the functions.php file?</h5>\n"
"<p>You can add your own functions.php file, and any other files and "
"directories you need for your Child Theme. The Child Theme Configurator "
"helps you identify and override the Parent stylesheet without touching the "
"other files.</p>\n"

"<h3 id=\"terms\">Glossary</h3>\n"
"<ul><li id=\"parent_theme\"><strong>Parent Theme</strong> The WordPress "
"Theme you wish to edit. WordPress first loads the Child Theme, then loads "
"the Parent Theme. If a style exists in the Child Theme, it overrides the "
"Parent Theme.</li>\n"
" <li id=\"child_theme\"><strong>Child Theme</strong> New Theme based on "
"Parent Theme. You can create any number of Child Themes from a single Parent "
"Theme.</li>\n"
" <li id=\"class\"><strong>Class</strong> A term used to organize objects. "
"For example, a &lt;div&gt; might be assigned the \"blue-text\" class. The "
"stylesheet might then assign the \"color: blue;\" rule to members of the "
"\"blue-text\" class. Thus, the &lt;div&gt; would display text as blue in the "
"browser.</li>\n"
" <li id=\"selector\"><strong>Selector</strong> One or more html elements, "
"classes, ids or other terms used to identify groups of objects.</li>\n"
" <li id=\"rule\"><strong>Rule</strong> One of many standardized attributes "
"used to tell the browser how to display objects matching a given selector. "
"Examples are <strong>color</strong>, <strong>background-image</strong> and "
"<strong>font-size</strong>.</li>\n"
"<li id=\"at-rule\"><strong>At-rule</strong> CSS browser instruction to "
"extend default functionality. The Child Theme Configurator supports two At-"
"rules:\n"
"<ul> <li id=\"import\"><strong>@import</strong> Instructs the browser to "
"load additional CSS information from an external source.</li>\n"
" <li id=\"query\"><strong>@media (Media Query)</strong> Identifies blocks of "
"styles that are used only when certain browser characteristics are true. "
"Examples are max-width, screen and print.</li>\n"
"</ul></li>\n"
" <li id=\"override\"><strong>Override</strong> When a selector exists in "
"both the Child Theme and the Parent Theme, the Child Theme takes priority "
"over the Parent theme. This is where the Child Theme Configurator stands "
"out: it helps you create <strong>exact overrides</strong> of selectors from "
"the Parent Theme, eliminating hours of trial and error.</li>\n"
