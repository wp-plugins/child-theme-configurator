== Overview ==

The Child Theme Configurator Plugin Extension (by the team that brought you IntelliWidget) makes it easy to make your plugins exactly match your theme.

You can create custom plugin styles from any plugin, even if it uses multiple stylesheets. The Child Theme Configurator Plugin Extension lets you choose from your installed plugins and save the results in your Child Theme directory.

== Getting Started ==

Read the instructions! If you are not familiar with our Child Theme Configurator, you will want to explore the documentation and videos first. http://www.lilaeamedia.com/plugins/child-theme-configurator/

Now that you are an expert with the Child Theme Configurator, select an existing Parent and Child Theme. 
IMPORTANT: Custom plugin styles are configured for a specific Child Theme, so you must create and select one first.

Now you can extend it using the "Extended Settings" tab. (See screenshot-1.)

Select the plugin stylesheet you want to customize from the "Source CSS to Activate" menu. IMPORTANT: Some stylesheets may be used in the WordPress Admin only. Only front-end stylesheets can be used to customize your website. If you are not sure, refer to the individual plugin's documentation to find the stylesheets to use. (See screenshot-2.)

Your active Source CSS options will now appear on the "Parent/Child" tab as the "Source CSS to Configure" dropdown menu. (See screenshot-3.)

Click "Generate Child Theme Files" and the plugin stylesheet can then be customized in exactly the same way as the Parent Theme stylesheet. If you need a refresher on using the Child Theme Configurator, read the instructions here.

== A few more notes: ==

1. The Child Theme Configurator Plugin Extension creates a new file for each Source CSS you active and puts it under the Child Theme in the "css" folder. If this directory does not exist, it creates it.
2. You must submit the "Parent/Child" form whenever you switch from one Source CSS option to another. The Child Theme Configurator reads the existing stylesheet so your previous styles will be loaded automatically.
3. If you need to deactivate a Source CSS option for any reason, you can use the "Source CSS to Deactivate" menu under "Extended Settings." (See screenshot-4.)

== Update Key ==

Your license includes software updates when they are released. To configure WordPress to automatically alert you of available updates, enter your Update Key in the box under "Extended Settings". Your Update Key was sent with the confirmation email you received with the download link. (See screenshot-5.)
